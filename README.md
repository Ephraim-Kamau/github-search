# GITHUB SEARCH
By Ephraim Kamau

# Description
This is an application that allows the user to search and view the various repositories that have been created on Github. To do this, the user types in the repository user name in the form and then presses Enter. The repository matching the name typed in is then displayed together with all its details. These details include the number of repositories, email address and the profile name.
